## About

My solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems used under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). This repository is meant for me to track my personal progress, but feel free to take a look around. All code is original and often represents my first successful solution; i.e., do not expect particularly optimized or elegant scripts.
