# ProjectEuler

## About

My solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems ([CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)). This repository is meant for me to track my personal progress, but feel free to take a look around. All code is original and often represents my first successful solution; i.e., do not expect particularly optimized or elegant scripts.

## Checklist

Average runtimes, in seconds, over 5 trials. These are very rough estimates and only intended to verify that solutions are under Project Euler's one minute runtime limit.
